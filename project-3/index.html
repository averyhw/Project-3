<!--INTRO-->

    <div class="row col-md-10">
      <p class="paragraph">ORANGE COUNTY, North Carolina â€” The ACT is one of the main standardized tests used in college entrance applications. Many high school students must go through the stressful process of completing this test to the best of their ability, determining where they will attend college. The average scores of each high school say a lot about its funding, teachers, students and overall educational experience. <br/><br/>When looking at the data from Orange County compared to the rest of the state of North Carolina, it is clear that Orange County is doing something right. <br/><br/>The county performs higher in every aspect than the average North Carolina high school, according to the <a href="https://opendurham.nc.gov/explore/dataset/north-carolina-school-performance-data/export/" target="_blank">Durham chapter of Open Data Soft</a>. This data set looks at ACT scores of North Carolina, Orange County and specifically Cedar Ridge High School and Orange High School. Some schools were not included in the data.
        <br/><br/>This data does not mean that Orange County schools are the best in the state, but it speaks to the programs offered in the county as they are performing above average according to their ACT scores.</p>
